HELP = """
I can convert GIFs and Videos to Video Stickers. Just send me the sticker and I'll do the rest for you. 
You will get your pack soon as you add a sticker. Send more gif/videos to add stickers in the current pack.

**Features**
1) Personalized video sticker packs
2) Multiple video sticker packs
3) Video to WEBM
4) Auto convert Video Sticker to WEBM
5) Customizable Sticker Emojis
6) Get list of packs using /packs
7) Settings to differentiate emojis for each pack
8) Kang mode to add stickers from other's packs
9) Set Default Emojis for all stickers

**Note**:
1) Try to send as small video/gif as possible as only first 3 seconds matter!
2) Don't try to care about audio as audio doesn't matter either! Same GIF and same Video without audio will give same result.
3) 'Ask for emojis' in /settings overrides 'Custom Emojis'
